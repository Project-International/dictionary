# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability
You can report any security vunerabilities with the programs, dictionaries, books and other media or file by using GitHub issues. You can use issues to report bugs and vunerabilities directly to the development team and be answered directly as well. Additionally if you are skilled enough, you can create a pull request and fix the bug yourself and it may be merged or committed to the main branch.
